## 🧪 Test Coverage

| Type           | Count |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Positive Tests | 14    |
| Negative Tests | 9     |
| Boundary Tests | 7     |
| Parameterized  | 4     |
| **Total**      | 34    |

### Coverage by Class

* BankAccount → 14 tests
* AccountManager → 12 tests
* Transaction → 8 tests

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* ❌ No data persistence (in-memory only)
* 🔐 No authentication system
* 🗑 Accounts deletable even with transactions
* ⚡ No concurrency handling

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* **JUnit 5 (5.10.0)** → Testing
* **Gson (2.10.1)** → JSON (optional, not used yet)

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

### 🔒 Encapsulation

* Private fields with controlled access

### 🧱 Abstraction

* AccountManager handles business logic

### 🔗 Composition

* Accounts contain transactions

### 🧬 Architecture

* Model-View separation

---

## 🧑‍💻 IDE Setup

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open project
2. Auto-import Maven dependencies
3. Run `BankManagerApp`

### Eclipse

1. Import as Maven project
2. Run as Java Application

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Add database (MySQL / MongoDB)
* Implement authentication system
* Add concurrency handling
* Improve UI (JavaFX or Web-based frontend)
